Password Generator

A simple and customizable Password Generator built using Python. This project allows users to generate strong, random passwords of different lengths and combinations. It is beginner-friendly and easy to understand.

Features
	•	Generates fully random passwords
	•	Supports uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols
	•	User can choose the password length
	•	User can copy or use the generated password anywhere
	•	Simple code, easy to modify
	•	Fast and lightweight

How It Works

The program uses Python’s built-in random and string libraries to form a character set.
From that character set, a password is generated by selecting characters randomly.

Requirements
	•	Python 3.x
	•	No external libraries required

How to Run
	1.	Install Python on your system
	2.	Download or clone the repository
	3.	Open the project folder
	4.	Run the script using the command:
	python password_generator.py
	Code Explanation
	•	Import characters from Python’s string module
	•	Combine all the characters into one list
	•	Ask the user for password length
	•	Use random.choice() to generate a password
	•	Print the final password
	Example Output
